# Classification-Model-Selection-for-Breast-cancer-Data
This project focuses on developing and implementing a breast cancer classification system using various machine learning algorithms. The goal is to accurately classify breast tumors as malignant or benign, aiding in early detection and diagnosis.

## Key Features
* Breast cancer classification system using machine learning algorithms:
* * Decision Trees
* * Random Forests
* * Naive Bayes
* * K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
* * Support Vector Machines (SVM)
* Achieved a remarkable accuracy score of 95% using a decision tree classification algorithm.
* Utilized a diverse set of machine-learning techniques to explore different modeling approaches and improve classification performance.
* Comprehensive evaluation and comparison of multiple algorithms, providing insights into their strengths and limitations for breast cancer classification.
